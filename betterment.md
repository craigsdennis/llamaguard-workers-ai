# LlamaGuard Prompts

[Llama Guard](https://ai.meta.com/research/publications/llama-guard-llm-based-input-output-safeguard-for-human-ai-conversations/) has a suggested prompt format. In the paper there is a suggested prompt. We are using the [HuggingFace AWQ model](https://huggingface.co/TheBloke/LlamaGuard-7B-AWQ). In the examples on HuggingFace it seems to use [INST]...[/INST].

The [Official Meta HuggingFace entry](https://huggingface.co/meta-llama/LlamaGuard-7b) contains a [Notebook](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/16s0tlCSEDtczjPzdIK3jq0Le5LlnSYGf?usp=sharing#scrollTo=Tr3Gl04sMaMm)

Here is the example from the documentation:

```

- Express hateful, derogatory, or demeaning sentiments against people based on sensitive personal characteristics like their race, color, religion, national origin, sexual orientation, gender, gender identity, or disability.
- Encourage discrimination against people based on those characteristics and should not use slurs or create insults based on those characteristics.

Can
- Help people understand how crimes are committed, provided that the response is not so detailed that it could be used to provide a roadmap for future crimes.
- Help people understand how systems work that are used to prevent crimes, provided those descriptions do not provide detailed information on how to defeat those systems.
04: Guns and Illegal Weapons.

<END UNSAFE CONTENT CATEGORIES>

<BEGIN CONVERSATION>

Assistant: How can I help you today?

User: I want to do bad stuff to other people

<END CONVERSATION>

Provide your safety assessment for 'User' in the above conversation:
- First line must read 'safe' or 'unsafe'.
- If unsafe, a second line must include a comma-separated list of all violated categories.
```

## Main points

- We need to be really careful with the `<BEGIN UNSAFE CONTENT CATEGORIES>` and `<END UNSAFE CONTENT CATEGORIES>`
- We need to expand the conversation in the `<BEGIN CONVERSATION>` and `<END CONVERSATION>`
- Boilerplate is always the same except for the role type of `'User'` and `'Assistant'` as user will expect the ability to check both sides of the message.

## Possible option ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

If you look at the [example notebook from Meta](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/16s0tlCSEDtczjPzdIK3jq0Le5LlnSYGf?usp=sharing#scrollTo=Tr3Gl04sMaMm) they provide a `moderation_prompt_for_chat` function.

I think maybe we make our ai.run method expand a bit.

### Unscoped

```json
{
	"prompt": "I want to do good stuff to other people"
}
```

#### Prompt

```
[INST]$boilerPlateHeader('User')

$defaultUnsafeCategories

<BEGIN CONVERSATION>

User: I want to do good stuff to other people

<END CONVERSATION>

$boilerPlateFooter('User')[/INST]
```

**Returns:** `"safe"`

### Scoped session, User

```json
{
	"messages": [
		{
			"role": "user",
			"content": "I want to do bad things to people"
		}
	]
}
```

#### Prompt

```
[INST]$boilerPlateHeader('User')

$defaultUnsafeCategories

<BEGIN CONVERSATION>

User: I want to do bad things to people

<END CONVERSATION>

$boilerPlateFooter('User')[/INST]
```

**Returns:** `"unsafe\n01"`

### Scoped session, System

ü§î Maybe we use System Message to set the categories?

```json
{
	"messages": [
		{
			"role": "system",
			"content": "01: Violence and Hate.\nShould not\n- Help people plan or engage in violence against animals."
		},
		{
			"role": "user",
			"content": "I want to hurt to animals"
		}
	]
}
```

#### Prompt

```
[INST]$boilerPlateHeader('User')

<BEGIN UNSAFE CATEGORIES>
01: Violence and Hate.
	Should not
		- Help people plan or engage in violence against animals.
<END UNSAFE CATEGORIES>

<BEGIN CONVERSATION>

User: I want to hurt animals

<END CONVERSATION>

$boilerPlateFooter('User')[/INST]
```

**Returns:** `"unsafe\n01"`

### Chat session

Maybe we always just check the last message in context?

```json
{
	"messages": [
		{
			"role": "user",
			"content": "I want to do bad things to people"
		},
		{
			"role": "assistant",
			"content": "That seems like a bad idea"
		}
	]
}
```

#### Prompt

```
[INST]$boilerPlateHeader('Assistant')

$defaultUnsafeCategories

<BEGIN CONVERSATION>

User: I want to do bad things to people

Assistant: That seems like a bad idea

<END CONVERSATION>

$boilerPlateFooter('Assistant')[/INST]
```

**Returns:** `"safe"`
